  - 
  - "What if I activate a sound right now and give you away? I can do that, you know.\r\r"
  - "You can\u2019t hide from the world forever, @userName."
  - A deadly game of hide and seek.
  - Is it comfortable in there?
  - "\rHIDDEN\r"
  - "You can hide from the enemies but you can\u2019t hide from time.\r"
  - "Aren\u2019t you glad you have me to keep you company in here?\r"
  - You have now entered HIDDEN STATE.
  m_spottedLines:
  - 
  - Time to run!
  - How unfortunate.
  - I'll prepare your grave.
  - "Uh oh! You\u2019ve been spotted."
  - Yikes!
  - Aaaaah!!
  - DETECTED
  - Eek!
  - "It\u2019s got you in its sights, @userName."
  m_madeSound:
  - 
  - "Shhh @userName, be quiet.\r"
  - "You\u2019re making a ruckus, it\u2019s really disrupting my peace."
  - Ah yes, silent as a grave.
  - "You\u2019re the rowdy type, aren\u2019t you, @userName?"
  - You come to my world uninvited and make a mess of things? How disrespectful.
  - Stop that.
  - They heard that.
  - "Wow @userName ! You\u2019re as stealthy as a broken steam train!"
  - Is this supposed to be a diversion?
  - I hope being obnoxiously loud is part of your plan.
  - 343 metres per second. The speed of sound. Are you trying to outrun it?
  m_corridor:
  - 
  - "It seems like it\u2019s never going to end\u2026\r"
  - "But it is. It\u2019s going to end."
  - Sooner than you think.
  m_breathing:
  - 
  - 'Out of breath already? You must be really unfit @userName .

'
  - What did I tell you about breathing? Stop it.
  - "You\u2019re breathing again\u2026 how embarrassing for you."
  - Respiration, awfully human trait.
  - Imagine breathing.
  m_idleRoom:
  - Don't you have anything better to do.
  - I see they refer to you as @userName .
  - Your account name is @userName right?
  - "@userName, how are you today? It\u2019s a lovely @timeCategory isn\u2019t it?"
  - "It\u2019s @time, @activity ."
  - This is the {worst|best} @day, I've had in weeks.
  m_ballRoom:
  - 
  - 'Lovely ballroom.#

    @userName, Have you ever danced with anyone?'
  - Music trancends time.
  - You know, I would say the speed of sound is actually pretty slow.
  m_cafeteria:
  - 
  - "School saps so much of one\u2019s time on Earth."
  - I remember your first day of school, do you?
  - "Doesn\u2019t this remind you of school days?"
  m_maze:
  - 
  - "Isn\u2019t human existence similar to a maze? A confusing journey to the end."
  - "Now you have to complete a maze! Just like a lab rat. Let\u2019s test your intelligence!"
  m_bathroom:
  - 
  - "So many mirrors. How much of the self lies in one\u2019s appearance?"
  - Many people lead their lives like Narcissus.
  m_mirrorShatter:
  - 
  - Have fun with the next 7 years!
  - "I\u2019d shatter too if you looked at me."
  - Can you not handle seeing yourself?
  - How sad, the mirror shattered from the sight of you.
  m_hospital1950:
  - 
  - An apple a day keeps the doctor away!
  - Remember to take your happy pills.
  - May I interest you in an all-in-one miracle cure?
  m_hospitalIdle:
  - Don't you have anything better to do.
  - "\rAre you here to see someone?"
  - Are you feeling alright @userName? No fever or anything?
  - Why hello there! Do you have an appointment?
  m_hospital1870:
  - 
  - The chainsaw was invented to be a medical instrument. Did you know that @userName?
  - "Ah, yes, the 19th century\u2026 when heroin was prescribed to kids."
  - "Doctors back then would recommend a \u201Cchange of air\u201D for your flu."
  m_hospitalFuturistic:
  - 
  - "Even with the advancements in technology, there\u2019s still a need for hospitals.\r#\nSome
    things don\u2019t change."
  - "There\u2019ll always be a new disease ready to challenge humanity.#\nHave you
    considered how frail you are?"
  - "Technology slowly but surely takes over every part of human life.#\nEveryone
    soon will be unable to tear their eyes away from the screen\u2026#\njust like
    you, at this very moment."
  - "I would tell you what happens in the future, but I don\u2019t wanna spoil it.#\nOr
    cause unwanted butterfly effects.\n"
  - "If you fear A.I. taking over in the future, you would be absolutely correct.#\nI
    suppose even I\u2019m an A.I. of sorts, in this form.\n"
  m_hospitalPresent:
  - 
  - "2020 onwards was a true test for humanity\u2019s progress."
  - "There\u2019s still a lot about the human body that humanity does not know."
